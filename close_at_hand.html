                Darkness... it was all that Klein saw and he felt like he just got out of a whirlpool. Still feeling a little dizzy, he sat up and looked around. He found out that he is sitting on top of a familiar bed.
            </p>

            <p>
                "What happened?", Klein murmured to himself. While Klein is still in a dilemma, he heard a voice that made him dumbfounded.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Klein! Klein! Thank goodness you&apos;re awake! Are you alright?"
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a voice laced with concern. Although a bit hazy, Klein can still see a silhouette of a girl that made him regret a lot of things.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Is… is that y…you? How? Didn&apos;t I...", Klein said in a voice trembling with fear and excitement. Fearing that the voice is just an imagination and excitement for it to be reality. When he saw her current appearance, realization dawned upon him as he remembered what happened.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a week before summer, February of 2019. Klein, with his childhood friend Aubrey, went inside a store to find an engagement ring.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Come on Audrey, help me find a good ring. You know, maybe something a woman like you would love", Klein jokingly said.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Hmph! I thought you would treat me to something but all I get is this", said Audrey grumpily while sending a resentful glare at Klein.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Come on, I&apos;ll treat you to something later after you pick a ring", Klein coaxed his childhood friend.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Hmph! I guess I&apos;ll forgive you then", Audrey giggled.
            </p>

            <p>
                Klein and Audrey bought a ring and immediately went to eat in a restaurant. While eating, Audrey chats with Klein.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I envy your girlfriend, Emmlyn. She&apos;s about to get engaged and yet here I am, single", Audrey jokingly said.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll be able to find someone and he&apos;ll sure be lucky to have you", said Klein reassuringly.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Yeah... yeah", said Audrey in a low voice as she lowers her head.
            </p>

            <p>
                Klein thought something was wrong and tried to look at Audrey&apos;s expression but he can&apos;t find anything weird. So, he just shrugged and continued to eat and chat happily with Audrey.
            </p>

            <p>
                *************************************
            </p>

            <p>
                After a week, it is already nearing summer and Klein plans to propose to Emmlyn. He has already thought of a way to surprise her, so he plans to go first to her place. While practicing his lines, he leaves the car and makes his way to her door. Feeling prepared, he was about to knock on the door when he heard a conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Get out of here before Klein comes, hurry!” said a woman's voice which is very familiar to Klein.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was Emmlyn!
            </p>

            <p>
                What was more surprising was that a man&apos;s voice immediately answered.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Okay, okay.... Why can&apos;t you just break up with him already?".
            </p>

            <p>
                Emmlyn answers, "I will, I&apos;m just looking for the right time to do so.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The door opened and they immediately saw Klein with tears in his eyes. Klein runs to get in his car and sped off.
            </p>

            <p>
                *************************************
            </p>

            <p>
                A while later, a loud crashing sound was heard.
            </p>

            <p>
                "BANG!" "BOOM!""
            </p>

            <p>
                *************************************
            </p>

            <p>
                Lying in a pool of blood, Klein was still crying but he heard something and tried to open his eyes. What appeared in his sight was Audrey&apos;s panicked and helpless expression, followed by her hysterical crying. He wanted to reach out and wipe her tears but he doesn&apos;t have enough strength. All that Klein could ever do was leave his last words, “I&apos;m... sorry, please take care... of... yourself".
            </p>

            <p>
                "No! No! I don&apos;t want you to die... no, I like you, Klein, I have always liked you. I want to marry you and be together forever, don&apos;t leave me, please, don&apos;t..." Audrey begged in tears. She threw herself on him and finally said the emotions that were hidden in her heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Seeing this, more than 15 years of memories with Audrey flashed in his mind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Klein always treated Audrey as his childhood friend and she was just always by his side.
            </p>

            <p>
                When he failed his college entrance examination, Audrey encouraged him to repeat his studies and she accompanied him to study hard every day. Eventually, they were admitted to the same university.
            </p>

            <p>
                When he has problems, Audrey accompanies him to get drunk. There were days when he gets sick and she takes care of him carefully.
            </p>

            <p>
                When he can&apos;t find a job for years, Audrey buys him food and secretly pays his rent.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the last moment, before his consciousness dissipated, Klein realized that people who are truly worthy of love and cherish are close at hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                *************************************
            </p>

            <p>
                After remembering those moments, Klein got out of his stupor and suddenly hugs the girl in front of him.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was Audrey!
            </p>

            <p>
                "What are you doing?!”, Audrey said in a somewhat panicky voice while struggling off his embrace.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Nothing, I just want to hug you", Klein said and grinned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Audrey gave up struggling and asked, “Are you okay?”
            </p>

            <p>
                “Yeah... What year is it again?”, Klein asked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although feeling a bit weirded out, Audrey said, “It is 2015, silly!”
            </p>

            <p>
                Klein let goes of Audrey and looks straight into her eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I like you Audrey", said Klein while looking at Audrey with a serious face.
            </p>

            <p>
                "What?!", Audrey stood still, dumbfounded.
            </p>

            <p>
                Klein hugs her again and says, "I like you Audrey and I want to be with you forever. I&apos;ll always protect you from now on. Will you be my girlfriend?”
            </p>

            <p>
                Audrey snapped out of it and excitedly hugs Klein back.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Yes! Of course! I will!
